# Origami
The flexible JavaScript backend framework that gets out of your way

```
npm i @axiand/origami@latest --registry="https://npm.pkg.github.com"
```

# About
Origami is a backend framework made to simplify the process of developing a backend. It strives to do this by taking a "keep it simple" approach wherever possible as well as providing the tools necessary to streamline common tasks.

# Principles
## Resilient
Origami handles server-side errors gracefully. Server-side errors will never crash your server entirely and errors are logged to the console automatically.

## Flexible
Origami does not force you down a certain path, and tries to stay out of your way as much as possible. You dictate how you lay out and manage your own code.

## Simple
Origami is easy to get started with and has a low difficulty curve. Anyone with beginner JavaScript knowledge can jump right in and start developing.

## Lightweight
Origami is not just three other libraries in a trenchcoat - in fact - it's quite the opposite. Origami tries to keep its dependencies to an absolute minimum, leading to lightning-fast startup and install times.
